// there are two options to view the page layout: grid and list.
// we are not able to view the list layout even though the button
// is still there.
//
// the interactive elements:
// the buttons
// the view layout
//
// toggling over the view layout icons will change the icon from
// light grey to blue when pressed. The file still toggles to blue,
// but it does not change the view layout.
//
// in the DOM, we are missing the class "cbp-vm-selected" in
// the href attribute. (which would specify the URL of the page
// the link goes to)
// I think including this would allow us to select the list?
//
// we are missing the <div> element with the id and style attributes
// at the end of the DOM. this will probably help the layout of the
// web page.
//
// TO FIX:
// establish a connection between JavaScript and HTML to make the
// website come alive. ex: linking the js file in the .html file.
// adding script tags.
//
// we need the js to connect the class by using getElementsByClassName
//
// we need a view class element to see the list layout.
//
// create a function for the view mode with loops
//
// use the window object to change orientation in the browser?
//
// execute two different loops: grid and list
