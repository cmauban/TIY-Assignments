#About JavaScript
###The Four Primitive Types:
1. `null`- 1 value. Intentionally empty value. Simplest type of expression.
  - ex: Number(null) // 0
2. `Boolean`- 2 values. comparing two things. (true and false)
   - ex: Boolean(0) // false
   - ex: Boolean(3) // true
   - ex: Boolean(null) // false
3. `Number`- made up of rationals.
  - ex: 3.1459
4. `String`- represents text. "words", textual data in quotes, numbers don't need quotes. Concatenate: putting two strings together.
  - ex: String("Hello World")

##Special Constants:
- `Inifinty`- numeric value representing infinity
  - ex: 4 / Infinity = 0
  - ex: 2 * Infinity = Infinity
- `NaN`- not a number. numeric data type that has an undefined value and cannot be represented.
  - ex: 0/0 // NaN
- `undefined`- a value that is undefined such as a variable that has not been assigned a value.
  - ex: Number(demo) // demo is not defined

##Basic Operators:
- Arithmetic, e.g. +, -, / : takes numerical values as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
  - ex: 3 + 2
  - ex: 4 / 2
  - ex: 3 - 1

- Comparison, e.g. >, <= :
 - Strict (===)- only true if the operands are the same type
   - ex: 3 === 3 // true
    - ex: 3 === "3" // false
 - Equality (==)- converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison
    - ex: 1 == "1" // true
    - ex: 1 == 1 // true
    - ex: 0 == false // true
    - ex: 0 == null // false
    - ex: null == undefined // true
 - relational abstract (<=)- operands are first converted to primitives, then to the same type, before comparison
    - ex: 3 <= 4 // true

- Assignment, e.g. var, =, += : assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
  - ex: x = y
  - ex: x += y (which means x = x + y)

- Unary operator- only one operand. ex: `typeof`, `return`
    - the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. ex: `typeof` name
  
- .(dot) operator- used to access a class, structure or union member. ex: `.length`

**Sequential Operation:** an order of expressions with the highest precedence first in a line. When this operation is put into a program, that is called control flow.

**Control Flow:** putting sequencial operations in a program. 

## Functions

Functions are a form of [control flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) used in computer programs. They are a snippet of code, when told to do its job, executes all of its statements.

FUNCTION INVOCATION: is when a function is invoked by placing parenthesis after it's identifier. Arguments are in the inputs provided to a function inovation.

ex:
```
  addition();
  Number(Boolean(null));
```

#####Functions have 3 things:

1. Input- parameters/arguments
2. Output- ex: return. (return value is always undefined unless noted)
3. Side Effects- outside of function ex: console.log

### `function` keyword

The `function` keyword is used to _define_ a function with parentheses and curly braces:

    // This is a Function Definition for `identifier`...
    function identifier ( /* arguments go here */ ) {
      // body of function goes here
    }

Once a function has been defined, it can be _invoked_ by a function name.

###Different types of functions:

- An **anonymous function** is a function without a function name: `function () {}`
 - `setTimeout` accepts a function as an argument. The correct way to pass a function as an argument is defining it as anonymous or giving the function a name. If you use parenthesis(brackets), you aren't actually passing a function, You are executing the function and passing the result of the function to setTimeout. So don't use parenthesis to pass.
 
      -ex: passing the return value of checkme();
```
             setTimeout(checkme(),4000)
```

             //but to pass it as a funtion...

```
              setTimeout(function(){checkme()},4000)
```
  
  - `setInterval` ex: Alert "Hello" every 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds)

```
              setInterval(function(){ alert("Hello"); }, 3000);
```

- A **named function** is a function with a function name: `function foo() {}`
- An **inner function** is a function inside another function (square in this case). An outer function is a function containing a function (addSquares in this case):
  - ex:
```
        function addSquares(a,b) {
        function square(x) {
         return x * x;
         }
          return square(a) + square(b);
       }
```
  - A **recursive function** is a function that calls itself. Used to solve problems that contain smaller sub-problems. can receive two inputs: a base case (ends recursion) or a recursive case (continues recursion).
    - ex:
```
       function loop(x) {
           if (x >= 10)
            return;
          loop(x + 1);
       }
```

##Control Flow Constructs

- Block Statements: The most basic statement. used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets:
```
{
  statement_1;
  statement_2;
  .
  .
  .
  statement_n;
}
```
   - block statement with control flow statement: { x++; } is the block statement
```
while (x < 10) {
  x++;
}
```
- Conditional Statements: a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. There are 2 conditional statements:
      - 1. `if... else`: to execute a statement if a logical *condition* is true. if, `return true;`else, `return false;`
```
              function checkData() {
                  if (document.form1.threeChar.value.length == 3) {
                     return true;
                   } else {
                     alert("Enter exactly three characters. " +
                     document.form1.threeChar.value + " is not valid.");
                     return false;
                   }
              }
```
  - 2. `switch`: allows a program to evaluate an *expression* and attempt to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement.
    - ex:
```
      switch (expression) {
        case label_1:
          statements_1
          [break;]
        case label_2:
          statements_2
          [break;]
          ...
        default:
          statements_def
          [break;]
      }
```
  ex: When break is encountered, the program breaks out of switch and executes the statement following switch. If break were omitted, the statement for case "Cherries" would also be executed.
    
```
    switch (expr) {
  case "Oranges":
    console.log("Oranges are $0.59 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Apples":
    console.log("Apples are $0.32 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Bananas":
    console.log("Bananas are $0.48 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Cherries":
    console.log("Cherries are $3.00 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Mangoes":
  case "Papayas":
    console.log("Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Sorry, we are out of " + expr + ".");
}

console.log("Is there anything else you'd like?");
```
    
###Loops

- **While Statement**: creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to `true`.
```
      while (condition) {
        statement
      }
```

ex: Write a while loop that logs "I'm looping!" to the console three times. You can do this however you like, but NOT with three console.log calls.

```
var count = 0
var loop = function(){
	while(count < 3){
		count++;
		console.log("I'm looping!");
	}
	
};

```


ex: `while loop` iterates as long as `n` is less than 3. Each iteration, the loop increments `n` and add its to `x`. after 3rd pass, condition `n < 3` is no longer `true` so loop ends.
```
  var n = 0;
  var x = 0;

  while (n < 3) {
     n++;
     x += n;
  }
```
ex: Inside the soloLoop function, write a while loop that takes an initial condition that's true. Your loop should log "Looped once!" to the console, then change that initial condition to false.

```
//Remember to make your condition true outside the loop!
i = true

var soloLoop = function(){
  while(i) {
  console.log("Looped once!");
  i = false;
  }
};

soloLoop();
```

- **Do..While Statements**: creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to `false`.
```
do
   statement
while (condition);
```
ex: `do...while` loop iterates at least once and reiterates until `i` is no longer less than 5.
```
    var i = 0;
    do {
      i += 1;
      console.log(i);
    } while (i < 5);
```
- **For Statements**: creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement or a set of statements executed in the loop.
```
    for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])
      statement
```
ex: `for` statement starts by declaring the variable `i` and initializing it to 0. It checks that `i` is less than nine, performs the two succeeding statements, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop.
```
    for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
       console.log(i);
       // more statements
}
```
## `Array`

### [Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2)

- to add onto the end of an array or push into an array: `<arrayname>.push();`
- to remove from the end of an array: `<arrayname>.pop();`
- to remove from the front of an array: `<arrayname>.shift();`
- to add to the front of an array: `<arrayname>.unshift();`
- to find the index of an item in the array (ex- finding "orange" in [berry,orange,mango] //1): `.indexOf(orange);`
- to remove an item by index position: `.splice();`
	- ex:
```
		fruits.push("Mango");
		// **["Strawberry", "Banana", "Mango"]**

		var pos = fruits.indexOf("Banana");
		// 1

		var removedItem = fruits.splice(pos, 1); // this is how to remove an item
		// ["Strawberry", "Mango"]

```
- `.length` example:
```
		var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

		for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  		numbers[i] *= 2;
		}
		// numbers is now [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
- to join all elements of an array into a string: `str = <arrayname>.join([separator = ','])`
	- ex:
```
		var a = ['Wind', 'Rain', 'Fire'];
		var myVar1 = a.join();      // assigns 'Wind,Rain,Fire' to myVar1
		var myVar2 = a.join(', ');  // assigns 'Wind, Rain, Fire' to myVar2
		var myVar3 = a.join(' + '); // assigns 'Wind + Rain + Fire' to myVar3
		var myVar4 = a.join('');    // assigns 'WindRainFire' to myVar4
```

#### [`Array.prototype.pop`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop)

* _params:_ none
* _returns:_ the last element
* _side-effects_: removes the element returned

##### Examples

ex: The for loop runs until i < 7 (because cities.length equals 7. The array cities has 7 elements in it. We will increment i by 1 each time we loop over. We print out cities[0], which is "Melbourne". We then start the loop again. Except now i = 1. It will print out cities[1], which is "Amman". This continues until i is no longer less than cities.length.

```
var cities = ["Melbourne", "Amman", "Helsinki", "NYC", "Raleigh", "Charlotte", "Greenville"];

for (var i = 0; i < cities.length; i++) {
    console.log("I would like to visit " + cities[i]);
```
