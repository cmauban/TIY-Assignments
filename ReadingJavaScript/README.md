# The four basic literal types (primitive):
1. null- 1 value. Intentionally empty value. 
  ex: Number(null)
      0
2. Boolean- 2 values (true and false)
  ex: Boolean(0)
      false
3. Number- made up of rationals. ex: 3.1459
4. String- "words", textual data in quotes, numbers don't need quotes.
  ex: String("Hello World")

Special constants:
Inifinty- numeric value representing infinity
  ex: 4 / Infinity = 0
      2 * Infinity = Infinity
NaN- not a number. numeric data type that has an undefined value and cannot be represented.
  ex: 0/0
      NaN
undefined- a value that is undefined such as a variable that has not been assigned a value.
  ex: Number(demo) // demo is not defined

##Basic Operators:
Arithmetic, e.g. +, -, / : takes numerical values as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
  ex: 3 + 2
      4 / 2
      3 - 1

Comparison, e.g. >, <= :
Strict (===)- only true if the operands are the same type
  ex: 3 === 3 // true
      3 === "3" // false
Equality (==)- converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison
  ex: 1 == "1" // true
      1 == 1 // true
      0 == false // true
      0 == null // false
      null == undefined // true
relational abstract (<=)- operands are first converted to primitives, then to the same type, before comparison
    ex: 3 <= 4 // true

Assignment, e.g. var, =, += : assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
  ex: x = y, x += y (which means x = x + y)
