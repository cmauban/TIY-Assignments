# Reading CSS 
Cascading Style Sheets describes how the structured elements in the document are to be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

A CSS rule contains 2 parts: a selector and declaration.
*Selectors* indicate which element the rule applies to. *Declarations* indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into 2 parts: a property and a value.

## Selectors
allows you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.
- **UNIVERSAL SELECTOR:** applies to all. targets all elements on the page ex: `* []`
- **TYPE SELECTOR:** matches element names. targets the h1, h2, h3 elements ex: `h1, h2, h3 []`
- **CLASS SELECTOR:** matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period operator. ex: `note []` targets an el whose class att has value of note. `p.note []` targets p elements whose class att has value of note.
- **ID SELECTOR:** matches an el whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the `#` symbol. ex: `#introduction []`
- **CHILD SELECTOR:** matches an el that is a direct child of another ex: `li>a []` targets an <a> el that are children of an <li> element. but not other <a> el in the page
- **DESCENDANT SELECTOR:** matches an el that is a descendent of another specified element, not jsut a direct child of that element. ex: `p a []` targets any a elements that sit inside a p element, even if there are other elements nested bw them.
- **ADJACENT SIBLING SELECTOR:** matches an element that is the next sibling of another ex: `h1+p []` targets the first p element after any h1 element, but not other p elements.
- **GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR:** matches an el that is a sibling of another, although it does not have to be the directly preceding element ex: `h1-p []` if you had 2 p elements that are siblings of an h1 element, this rule would appy to both.


## Properties

*to get layout to do something different: display(block or inline), float, and position(top,right,bottom,left)*

- **`display`**: most important property for controlling layout. used to turn an inline el, into an block-level el, or vice versa. used to hide an element from the page. Every element has a default display value, most being either `block` (block-level element) or `inline` (inline elemet).
  - VALUES:
  - `block-level element`: starts on a new line. `div` is the standard block-level element. `<h1>-<h6>`, `<p>`, `<form>`, `<li>` are common block elements.
  - `inline element`: flow within the text. `span` is the standard inline element. can wrap text inside a paragraph `<span> like this </span>` without disrupting the flow of that paragraph. `a` element is common.
  - `none`: no layout. `script` use this as their default. It is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without really deleting and recreating them. will render the page as though the element does not exist.
  - `flex`: 
  - `inline-block` element: just like inline but with `width` and `height`. USE THIS INSTEAD OF FLOAT FOR GRID OF BOXES. (DONT NEED TO USE CLEAR) ex:
```
        .box2 {
          display: inline-block;
          width: 200px;
          height: 100px;
          margin: 1em;
        }
```
  - `inline-block` elements can also be used for LAYOUTS. affected by the `vertical-align` property, which you probably want set to `top`. need to set width of each column. There will be a gap between the columns if there is any whitespace between them in the HTML. ex:
      
```
      nav {
        display: inline-block;
        vertical-align: top;
        width: 25%;
      }
      .column {
        display: inline-block;
        vertical-align: top;
        width: 75%;
      }
```
- **`visibility`**: allows you to hide boxes from users but it leaves a space where the element would have been.
  - VALUES:
  - `hidden` blank space will appear in its place. if you DONT want the blank space, USE DISPLAY PROPERTY W/ A VALUE OF NONE.
  - `visible`
- **`position`**: for more complex layouts. a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except `static`.
  - VALUES:
  - `static`/`normal flow` is the default value. vertically down the page. *not positioned*
  - `relative` same as static but with `top, right, bottom, left`.
  - `absolute` move as users scroll up and down. behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport.
  - `fixed` positioned relative to the viewport. stays in same place even when page is scrolled. `top, right, bottom, left` properties are used. PERCENTS used
- **`float`**: 1. changes the width of an element. 2. other ajacent elements move. 3. adjacent text "floats" around the element. left and right. wrapping text around images. you can take the element out of the normal flow. the floated el becomes a block-level el around which other content can flow. (like text wrap)
    - it affects the width of an element by the width becoming dependent on the contained content.
    - height is still the same of the containing element
- **`clear`**: controlling the behavior of floats. no element should touch the left or right hand sides of a box. so the elements don't overlap.
- **`clearfix`**: the clearfix hack will fix floats when the image is taller than the element so it's overflowing outside of its container.
  - ex: 
```
        .clearfix {
          overflow: auto;
```
- **`Media queries`**: for mobile devices. The `and` keyword is used for combining multiple media features together, as well as combining media features with media types. "Responsive Design" is the strategy of making a site that "responds" to the browser and device that it is being shown on. ex: Let's take our layout that uses percent widths and have it display in one column when the browser is too small to fit the menu in the sidebar:
```
    @media screen and (min-width:600px) {
      nav {
        float: left;
        width: 25%;
  }
     section {
       margin-left: 25%;
  }
}
    @media screen and (max-width:599px) {
     nav li {
       display: inline;
  }
}
```
- **`column`**: make multi-column text. (ex: `.three-column`)
- **`z-index`**: allows you to control which box appears on top. fixes overlapping elements.


####Box Model Properties
- **`box-sizing`**: used to alter the default CSS box model. When you set `box-sizing: border-box;` on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width. use: use the `-webkit-` and `-moz-` prefixes.
  - VALUES:
  - content box: default style. width and height properties are measured including only the content, but not the padding, border or margin. Note: Padding, border & margin will be outside of the box EX: IF `.box {width: 350px};` THEN you apply `{border: 10px solid black;}` RESULT {rendered in the browser} `.box {width: 370px;}`
  - border box: width and height properties include the padding and border, but not the margin. Note that padding and border will be inside of the box EX:  `.box {width: 350px; border: 10px solid black;}` lead to a box rendered in the browser of `width: 350px`. 





**EXAMPLE STYLES**

BOXES
- width and height
- borders (color, width and style)
- background color and images
- position in the browser window

- **every box has 3 available properties:**
  - 1. **border:** separates the edge of one box from another. 0 pixels wide
  - 2. **margin:** sit outside the edge of the border. gaps.
  - 3. **padding:** think of the padding as extending the content. space bw the border of a box and any content contained within it.
- **..with a `min` or `max` property:**
  - `min-width/height` property is used to set the minimum width of a given element.
    - VALUES of min overrides both max-width/height and width/height.
    - length, percentage
  - `max-width/height` property is used to set the maximum width of a given element.
    - VALUES of max overrides the width/height, BUT NOT the min width/height.
    - none, length, percentage



TEXT
- typeface
- size
- color
- italics, bold, up/low case, small-caps

####CSS units & dots-per-inch
- `1in is always 96px`
- `3pt is always 4px`
- `25.4mm is always 96px`

```
TWELEVE PIXEL SCALE:

pixels = percentages = ems

24px = 200% = 1.5em
18px = 150% = 1.3em
14px = 117% = 0.875em
32px = 200% = 2em

SIXTEEN PIXEL SCALE:

32px = 200% = 2em
24px = 150% = 1.5em
18px = 112.5% = 1.125em
```

###Typographic Elements
#####FONT PROPERTIES:
- **`font-family`**: allows you to specifiy the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element. The VALUE is the name of the typeface. list of fonts for alternative fonts if not installed on cpu. end with a generic font name such as sans serif. if font name is more than one word, it needs to be in "Courier New".
- **`font-size`**: enables you to specify a size for the font.
  - PIXELS: default size of text is `16px`. appears the size you intend it to be. relative (will look larger on a smaller screen) very precise control over how much space their text takes up. `px`
  - PERCENTAGES: default size of text is `16px`. 75% of that would be 12px, 200% would be 32px. EX: if you create a rule to make all text inside `body` element 75% of default size (12px), then make another rule that indicates the content of an element inside the `body` element should be 75%, it will be 9%.
  - EMS: equivalent to the width of a letter m. allow you to change the size of text relative to the size of the text in the parent element. EX: `16px = 100; 18xpx = 1.125em`
- **`@font-face`**: allows you to use a font, even if its not installed on the computer by specifying a path to a copy of the font (which would be downloaded) ex:
```
      @font-face {
        font-family: 'ChunkFiveRegular';
        src: url('fonts/chunkfive.eot');}
```
    - font formats should appear in this order:
      1. eot
      2. woff
      3. ttf/otf
      4. svg

- **`font-weight`**: allows you to create bold text. 2 VALUES: normal and bold.
- **`font-style`**: create italics. 3 VALUES: normal, italic, oblique.

#####TEXT PROPERTIES:
- **`text-transform`**: change the case of text. 3 VALUES: uppercase, lowercase, capitalize(only first letter).
- **`text-decoration`**: specifys the VALUES of:
    - `none`- removes any decoration already applied
    - `underline`- adds a line underneath
    - `overline`- adds a line over the top of text
    - `line-through`- adds a line through words
    - `blink`- animates the text to make it flash on and off
- **`text-align`**: control the alignment of text. VALUES: left, right, center, justify (every line except last should take up th full width of the containing box. creates equal gaps)
- **`text-indent`**: allows you to indent the first line of text within the element.
- **`text-shadow`**: creates a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset. creates an embossed effect by adding a shadow that is slightly lighter than the text.
- **`vertical-align`**:

#####Pseudo-Elements
*put at the end of the selector. acts like an extra element in the code.

- `:first-letter`: only affects the first letter of text.
- `:first-line`: only affects the first line of text.
```
    p.intro:first-letter {
      font-size: 200%; }
    p.intro:first-line {
      font-weight: bold; }
```
#####Pseudo-Classes
*acts like an extra value for a class attribute.

*When pseudo-classes are used, they appear in this order:*

- `:link`: allows you to set styles for links that have NOT yet been visited.
- `:visited`: allows you to have diff styles for links that HAVE BEEN visited/clicked on.
- `:hover`: changes appearance. allows you to style elements diff when a user hovers over them.
- `:focus`: applied when an element has focus. any element that you can interact with like a link you can click on or any form control can have focus. occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an element on the page. ex: when your cursor is in a form input ready to accept typing. that element has focus.
- `:active`: applied when an element is being activated by a user. ex: when a button is being pressed or a link being being clicked.


#####LINE PROPERTIES:
*LEADING: vertical space bw lines of text. measured by the bottom of the desecender to the top of the ascender.*
*KERNING: space bw each letter.*

**VALUES for these properties are in `ems` and added on top of the default value**
- **`line-height`**: sets the height of the entire line of text so the diff bw the font-size and line-height is equivalent to the leading.
- **`letter-spacing`**: controls the kerning (space bw each letter). do ths when heading is all uppercase.
- **`word-spacing`**: control the gap bw words. the default gap is often after `0.25em` and prob need to change regularly. if bold, increase.

- color

*pay attention to units that you canemploy when defining rules for font-size and line-height and document what the percentage values are relative to.

### [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) 

The text color of an element and its decorations (??)

#### Possible Values: [any `<color>` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value)

* a hexadecimal color value: `#012345`, `#CCC` 0-9 or a-f
* a color keyword: `cornflowerblue`, `purple`, `orange`
* RGB decimal notation: `rgb(0,0,0)`, `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
* RGBa (transparency) notation: `rgba(0,0,0,0)`, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)` (rgb function)
* HSL decimal notation (hue, saturation, lightness): `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`
