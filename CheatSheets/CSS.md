# Reading CSS 
Cascading Style Sheets describes how the structured elements in the document are to be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

A CSS rule contains 2 parts: a selector and declaration.
*Selectors* indicate which element the rule applies to. *Declarations* indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into 2 parts: a property and a value.

## Selectors
allows you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.
- UNIVERSAL SELECTOR
- TYPE SELECTOR
- CLASS SELECTOR
- ID SELECTOR
- CHILD SELECTOR
- DESCENDANT SELECTOR
- ADJACENT SIBLING SELECTOR
- GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR

## Properties

**EXAMPLE STYLES**

BOXES
- width and height
- borders (color, width and style)
- background color and images
- position in the browser window
- every box has 3 available properties:
  - 1. border: separates the edge of one box from another. 0 pixels wide
  - 2. margin: sit outside the edge of the border. gaps.
  - 3. padding: space bw the border of a box and any content contained within it.

TEXT
- typeface
- size
- color
- italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase and small-caps


- **`display`**: most important property for controlling layout. used to turn an inline el, into an block-level el, or vice versa. used to hide an element from the page. Every element has a default display value, most being either `block` (block-level element) or `inline` (inline elemet).
  - VALUES:
  - `block-level element`: starts on a new line. `div` is the standard block-level element. `<h1>-<h6>`, `<p>`, `<form>`, `<li>` are common block elements.
  - `inline element`: flow within the text. `span` is the standard inline element. can wrap text inside a paragraph `<span> like this </span>` without disrupting the flow of that paragraph. `a` element is common.
  - `none`: `script` use this as their default. It is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without really deleting and recreating them. will render the page as though the element does not exist.
  - `inline-block` element: just like inline but with `width` and `height`. USE THIS INSTEAD OF FLOAT FOR GRID OF BOXES. (DONT NEED TO USE CLEAR) ex:
```
        .box2 {
          display: inline-block;
          width: 200px;
          height: 100px;
          margin: 1em;
        }
```
  - `inline-block` elements can also be used for LAYOUTS. affected by the `vertical-align` property, which you probably want set to `top`. need to set width of each column. There will be a gap between the columns if there is any whitespace between them in the HTML. ex:
      
```
      nav {
        display: inline-block;
        vertical-align: top;
        width: 25%;
      }
      .column {
        display: inline-block;
        vertical-align: top;
        width: 75%;
      }
```
- **`visibility`**: allows you to hide boxes from users but it leaves a space where the element would have been.
  - VALUES:
  - `hidden` blank space will appear in its place. if you DONT want the blank space, USE DISPLAY PROPERTY W/ A VALUE OF NONE.
  - `visible`
- **`box-sizing`**: When you set `box-sizing: border-box;` on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width. use: use the `-webkit-` and `-moz-` prefixes.
- **`position`**: for more complex layouts. a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except `static`.
  - VALUES:
  - `static`/`normal flow` is the default value. vertically down the page. *not positioned*
  - `relative` same as static but with `top, right, bottom, left`.
  - `absolute` move as users scroll up and down. behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport.
  - `fixed` positioned relative to the viewport. stays in same place even when page is scrolled. `top, right, bottom, left` properties are used. PERCENTS used
- **`float`**: wrapping text around images. you can take the element out of the normal flow. the floated el becomes a block-level el around which other content can flow. (like text wrap)
- **`clear`**: controlling the behavior of floats. no element should touch the left or right hand sides of a box. so the elements don't overlap.
- **`clearfix`**: the clearfix hack will fix floats when the image is taller than the element so it's overflowing outside of its container.
  - ex: 
```
        .clearfix {
          overflow: auto;
```
- **`Media queries`**: for mobile devices. The `and` keyword is used for combining multiple media features together, as well as combining media features with media types. "Responsive Design" is the strategy of making a site that "responds" to the browser and device that it is being shown on. ex: Let's take our layout that uses percent widths and have it display in one column when the browser is too small to fit the menu in the sidebar:
```
    @media screen and (min-width:600px) {
      nav {
        float: left;
        width: 25%;
  }
     section {
       margin-left: 25%;
  }
}
    @media screen and (max-width:599px) {
     nav li {
       display: inline;
  }
}
```
- **`column`**: make multi-column text. (ex: `.three-column`)
- **`z-index`** allows you to control which box appears on top. fixes overlapping elements.

### [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) 

The text color of an element and its decorations (??)

#### Possible Values: [any `<color>` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value)

* a hexadecimal color value: `#012345`, `#CCC`
* a color keyword: `cornflowerblue`, `purple`, `orange`
* RGB decimal notation: `rgb(0,0,0)`, `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
* RGBa (transparency) notation: `rgba(0,0,0,0)`, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)`
* HSL decimal notation: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`
